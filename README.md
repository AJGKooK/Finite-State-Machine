# Machine_Calculator

This is a calculator based from a Register File, an ALU, and a Finite State machine.  The calculator will output to all 8 hex outputs.  The register file stores the data and outputs to both the eight 7-digit hex outputs on the Altera board, and also feeds data back into the ALU and finite state machine for modification.
